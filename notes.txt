this
- in js 'this' refers to the object it was called upon
- if you call obj.someMethod, this refers to obj
- if you call someMethod, this will be null
- you can force a specific value for this by calling bind(), call() apply()
- or if the function is an arrow => function, this is hardcoded to refer to the location the function was defined. 
- Note: 2 same functions arent equal
